# Hangman-Game

In this project, I used multithreading to have multiple clients connected to the single server. I firstly established handshake connections between the server and the client. Server is responsible of keeping track of the number of connected clients (threads). When it is above 3, it will send an error message to the client to gracefully terminate the connection. Then the server will select a random word from the hangman_words.txt file. Based on client input, we will decide if the game should start. I also set up error messages for incorrect input format. After the game starts, the client will guess a letter of the target word. If it is correct, the server will respond the new partial word with the correct letter guess. If it is wrong, it will show the last wrong guesses. At the same time, the server is keeping track of number of guesses the user has spent or if the correct word has been guessed. At the end, based on whether the client filled up all the underscores and whether the client spent all the guesses, the server will send the corresponding messages to indicate the game result. Then the game finishes. During the period, the server is in a loop to keep listening for client connection and starting a game.
